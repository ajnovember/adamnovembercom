								<div class = "ppage_description">I built this slide guitar in Summer 2013 for an acoustics class. I made a nut and bridge by suspending two bolts, each held in place by two L brackets, on opposite sides of the guitar. The tuning system involves wrapping each string around a screw such that tightening the screw pulls the string further out of its original path, tightening it and raising its pitch. I used a spare single coil guitar pickup, with the output jack soldered straight to the pickup. I generally keep it tuned to a minor 7 chord, so I can play minor triads on the bottom three strings and major triads on the top three. The various screws screwed in along the wood are under the strings are fret markers, with distances calculated using the harmonic series. They mark the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, and 12th frets, aka the minor 3rd, major 3rd, perfect 4th, perfect 5, and octave intervals, aka the 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd and 1st harmonics.</div>
